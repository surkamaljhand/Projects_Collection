Title: Banker's Algorithm Implementation

Description:
The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for the safety of resource allocation to processes in a system. This program is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to input the number of processes, the number of resources, the available resources, the maximum resource allocation matrix, and the current resource allocation matrix. By clicking the "Check Safety" button, the program will determine if the system is in a safe or unsafe state.



Requirements:

Python 3.6 or higher
Tkinter library
Installation:

Ensure that you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your computer. You can check the version by running python --version or python3 --version in your command prompt or terminal.
Install the Tkinter library if it is not already installed. It usually comes pre-installed with Python. If it's not present, you can install it using the following command:

pip install tk
or
pip3 install tk


Usage:

Run the bankers_algorithm.py script using Python. You can do this by executing the following command in your command prompt or terminal:


python bankers_algorithm.py
or
python3 bankers_algorithm.py
Input the number of processes and resources using the spinboxes provided.

Enter the available resources for each resource type using the spinboxes.

Input the maximum resource allocation matrix in the "Maximum Resource Allocation" text box. Each row should represent the maximum resources a process requires, and commas should separate the values. Add one row per process.

Input the current resource allocation matrix in the "Current Resource Allocation" text box. Each row should represent the resources currently allocated to a process, and commas should separate the values. Add one row per process.

Click the "Check Safety" button to run the Banker's Algorithm. The result will be displayed below the button, indicating whether the system is safe or unsafe. If the system is in a safe state, a safe sequence of processes will be displayed.



Example:

Run the bankers_algorithm.py script.

Input the following values:

Number of processes: 5
Number of resources: 3
Available resources: [10, 5, 7]

Maximum resource allocation matrix:
7, 5, 3
3, 2, 2
9, 0, 2
2, 2, 2
4, 3, 3

Current resource allocation matrix:
0, 1, 0
2, 0, 0
3, 0, 2
2, 1, 1
0, 0, 2

Click the "Check Safety" button.

The result displayed will be:

The system is in a safe state.
Safe sequence: P0, P1, P2, P3, P4
